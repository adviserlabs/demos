# Protein/Ligand Binding Affinities
`biomedMolecularDynamicsSim.py` - Small molecule protein binding simulation.
Creates a bunch of proteins and ligands and then creates some mock data for
binding affinity then generates charts and graphs. Data is written into a TSV
in case we wanted to replace it with some actual data.
