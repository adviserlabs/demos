# Stock Ticker Analysis
`stockAnalyzer.py` - It has zero dependencies. Creates a bunch of fake tickers,
generates trade data for the over a long period, then does some analysis on
the biggest winners/losers. Outputs charts so it actually looks like
something.

## Running the Demonstration
`adviser run "python ./stockAnalyzer.py"`
